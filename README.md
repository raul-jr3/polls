# polls
A simple polls application using Django.

In order to try it, clone the repostitry to your desired location.<br/>
cd into the mysite directory.<br/><br/><br/>
I've used postgresql as the database.<br/>
If you want to use any other databases like SQLite or MySQL make the necessary changes in settings.py file.<br/><br/>
Open the terminal (Command Prompt for Windows) and enter "python manage.py createsuperuser" and add a username, e-mail and a password.<br/>
Start the server using "python manage.py runserver". Then open your desired web browser and enter "http://127.0.0.1:8000".<br/>
Go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" and login using the superuser account you created.<br/>
Select the Questions and Add a desired question along with the choices, update the date and time and hit save.<br/>
Then go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000" to view the website.
